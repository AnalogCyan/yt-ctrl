# Contributing to yt-ctrl

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

#### **When contributing, please:**

*  Keep your code clean.

*  Be kind, we're all here to learn and help together!

#### **Adding functionality:**

If you're looking to help add functionality to this, feel free to fork and make it so. I threw this together super quick in an evening just for one function, but it should be structured such that adding new functionality is fairly simple.
